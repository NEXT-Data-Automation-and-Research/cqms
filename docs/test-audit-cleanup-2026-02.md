# Test Audit Cleanup (Feb 2026)

A one-time cleanup was done to remove **test audits and reversals** for the people listed below so they no longer appear in the platform.

---

## Who was affected

- **Saif Ivna Alam**
- **Aminul Borhan** (including test accounts: Aminul test user, Aminul Islam, Quality Analyst Aminul-TEST)

---

## What was removed

| Item | Count |
|------|--------|
| Audit assignments | 10 |
| Reversal requests | 2 |
| Audit score records (first cleanup) | 3 |
| Audit score records (fnchat_cfd_v4_0_v2, second cleanup) | 13 |

**Breakdown (second cleanup, Feb 10):**
- **Aminul (test user)** (aminulislamborhan@gmail.com): 12 rows
- **Aminul Islam** (aminul.islam@nextventures.io): 1 row

All related data was also removed (e.g. reversal history, activity logs, review records) so nothing is left for these test audits.

---

## Result

- No test audits or reversals for these users remain in the system.
- Reports and dashboards will no longer include this test data.

If you need a similar cleanup in the future, ask your admin or refer to this document.
