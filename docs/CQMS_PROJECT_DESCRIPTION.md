# CQMS Project Description

In a major step forward for audit speed, data ownership, and long term cost control, Aminul Islam and Saif Alam designed and built an internal CQMS (Communication Quality Management System) to support QC led communication audits for the CEx department.

While CQMS is currently used for CEx, it was built with a bigger goal in mind. The system is flexible by design. Audit rules, scoring, and workflows can be adjusted. This allows CQMS to support communication audits across other departments in the future without rebuilding anything. Built on Clean Architecture principles with modular design, the platform features 15+ core modules including audit creation, distribution, performance tracking, coaching, reversals, and comprehensive analytics, all designed to scale with organizational growth.

CQMS runs on an internal database powered by Supabase, which means all audit data, scores, and feedback stay fully in house. The platform implements strong security measures with database-level protection, authentication controls, and comprehensive audit logging to keep all quality information safe and secure. With 9 database migrations establishing a robust schema and complete data isolation, CQMS is built as a strong potential replacement for the paid tool Scorebuddy, helping the company reduce long term vendor costs while using a system designed exactly for internal quality needs.

By integrating Intercom directly into CQMS, Aminul and Saif removed the need to switch between tools. The full audit journey from chat review to scoring, feedback, acknowledgment, and reversals now happens in one place. This streamlined workflow, combined with AI-powered audit assistance and intelligent conversation filtering, significantly reduced audit time, allowing the QC team to complete more audits in the same time and substantially increase overall audit capacity.

## Key Contributions

### 3. Kept All Audit Data Fully In House
- Used Supabase to securely store all audit data, scores, and feedback.
- Protected valuable quality and communication information.
- Built a solid data base that supports future expansion and insights.
- Implemented 9 comprehensive database migrations establishing complete schema for users, audits, notifications, scorecards, and audit assignments.
- Created robust data foundation with indexed tables, foreign key constraints, and automated timestamp management supporting high-performance queries.
- Established complete data isolation ensuring all quality intelligence remains entirely within company infrastructure.

### 4. Made Audits Faster and Easier for QC
- Added AI support to help auditors work faster and stay consistent.
- Designed the system around how QC auditors actually work.
- Kept audit quality high while improving speed and clarity.
- Developed AI-assisted audit workflows enabling bulk conversation processing with intelligent scorecard matching.
- Created intelligent conversation filtering with multi-criteria selection (date ranges, channels, CSAT scores, CX metrics, error detection).
- Implemented AI audit controls supporting batch processing of selected conversations with automated scoring suggestions.
- Built real-time status tracking for AI processing states with user feedback.

### 5. Brought Everything into One Platform with Intercom
- Connected Intercom directly to CQMS, removing tool switching.
- Enabled full audits in one place including review, scoring, feedback, and reversals.
- Made daily work easier for both QC auditors and CEx users.
- Engineered seamless Intercom API integration enabling direct conversation retrieval, filtering, and analysis within CQMS.
- Created intelligent conversation panel with advanced filtering by client, subject, CSAT, CX score, channel, date range, and error detection.
- Implemented real-time conversation status tracking with AI processing indicators and bulk selection capabilities.

### 6. Saved Time and Increased Audit Capacity
- Reduced audit time through optimized workflows, integrated processes, and AI-powered assistance.
- Enabled the QC team to complete significantly more audits in the same time.
- Used data and insights to spot trends and improve quality faster.
- Leveraged data-driven insights with comprehensive statistics, trend analysis, and performance dashboards.
- Implemented caching strategies reducing database load and improving response times.
- Created parallel data loading patterns enabling efficient dashboard initialization and real-time updates.

## Impact

Aminul Islam and Saif Alam did not just build a tool. They changed how communication quality works. CQMS made audits faster, clearer, and fully owned by the company. It strengthened data control, helped QC teams scale their work, supported CEx users with clear feedback, and created a system that can grow beyond CEx to support communication audits across the organization. The system's modular architecture and flexible design ensure it can evolve with the company's needs, making it a true long-term investment in quality excellence.

With strong security measures protecting all data, comprehensive Intercom integration eliminating tool-switching friction, and AI-powered assistance accelerating workflows, CQMS represents a transformative platform that positions the company to eliminate $3,600+ in annual vendor costs while establishing a robust foundation for organization-wide quality management expansion. 

## One-Liner

Aminul Islam and Saif Alam built CQMS, a fully company-owned, AI-powered quality platform that streamlines QC-led CEx audits through seamless Intercom integration, intelligent automation, and unified workflows, delivering faster audits, complete data ownership, increased audit capacity, and potential annual savings of $3,600+ by replacing Scorebuddy, all while establishing a scalable foundation for organization-wide quality management.
